First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Metro "takes in an entry file and various options, and returns a single JavaScript file that includes all your code and its dependencies."

To start Metro, inside your React Native Folder:

npx react-native start

This will start the metro bundler. 

Open a new terminal inside your React Native folder and run:

npx react-native run-android

This will launch the app on your device.

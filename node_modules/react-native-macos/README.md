> See the official [React Native website](https://reactnative.dev/) for an introduction to React Native. 

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev) is a framework developed by Facebook that enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and [React](https://reactjs.org/). The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms you care about - learn once, write anywhere.

This repository is a working fork of **facebook/react-native** that adds support for the official React Native for macOS implementation from Microsoft. 

You can read more about the macOS implementation in our website - [React Native for Windows and Mac](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/)

## Requirements

You can run React Native for macOS apps on Mac devices with versions [Mojave (10.14.6)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209149#macos10146) or newer.

For a full and detailed list of the system requirements and how to set up your development platform, see our [System Requirements](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnm-dependencies) documentation on our website.

## Getting Started
See the [Getting Started Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnm-getting-started) on our React Native for Windows and Mac website to build your first React Native for macOS app.

### Logging Issues
Search the [existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/issues) and try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist before opening a new issue. If your issue doesn't exist yet, try to make sure you provide as much information as possible to us so we can help you sooner. It’s helpful if you include information like:

- The version of macOS, React Native, React Native macOS extension where you ran into the issue.
- A stack trace and reduced repro case when possible.
- Ensure the [appropriate template](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/issues/new/choose) is used when filing your issue(s).

##  Contributing
See [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to setup your fork of the repo and start a PR to contribute to React Native for macOS.

[Good First Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/labels/good%20first%20issue) and [help wanted](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/labels/help%20wanted) are great starting points for PRs.

## Documentation
[React Native already has great documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html) and we're working to ensure the React Native for Windows and Mac are part of that documentation story.

[React Native for Windows and Mac](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/) has it's own separate documentation site where Windows and Mac specific information, like API docs and blog updates live. We are bootstrapping documentation for macOS at this time, tune in for updates.

### Examples

- Using the CLI in the [Getting Started](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnm-getting-started) guide will set you up with a sample React Native for macOS app that you can begin editing right away.
- If you're looking for sample code, just browse the [RNTester folder](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/tree/master/RNTester) for examples
